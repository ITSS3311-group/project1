# ITSS project 1

### I am thinking of picking this project below.

###Example 7. You are required to create a simple slot machine with three slots. Each slot will generate a random number from 1 to 9. The user will start with 100 coins and can bet any number of coins per slot pull. The payouts are defined as follows: 
If 2 slots equal each other the user wins 2x the bet.
If 3 slots equal each other the user wins 10x the bet. 
If 0 slots equal the user loses the bet. 
The game continues until the user is out of coins or the user chooses to quit the game by entering 0. 
Your program checks to be sure that the user bets appropriate amount of coins for a play (i.e., 0<betâ‰¤current coins).
